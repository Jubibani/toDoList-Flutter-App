My first Flutter Project will be named as 'firstly'. (i just copied from someone's project name lol)
what is flutter anyways, seems flutter is:
 a mobile app UI toolkit and development framework created by Google. Some key technical aspects at a high level:

It uses the Dart programming language for writing app logic and UI code. Dart compiles to fast native code for iOS and Android.
The UI components and views are not native platform controls. Instead Flutter renders its own high-performance Skia graphics engine to draw widgets with rich animations and effects.
These widgets and views are built using Flutter's reactive framework called Flutter Widgets. You compose UIs by nesting and combining many simple widget building blocks.
The widget tree then syncs with the rendering engine to redraw views whenever widget state changes. This declarative paradigm avoids manual DOM manipulation.
Development is done in Visual Studio Code or editors with Flutter plugins. Tools like "hot reload" inject updated source code without losing app state to refresh UIs in milliseconds during development.
Flutter apps have native performance since the Dart code compiles down to ARM assembly code. There's no interpreted JavaScript bridge. Combine that with Skia's GPU rendering and UIs feel very fast and smooth.
